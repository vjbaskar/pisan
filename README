## A general conf file in 

The main config file is ~/.$USER/pisan.conf
If you provide a conf file with the commands it will overwrite options of pisan.conf

## Main command

pisan 

# Depends on

* Rscript
* BASH
* BASH -> getopts
* UCSC utilities
* samtools
* macs2
* bwa
* star
* Any relevant bio tools should be added to $PATH

# How it works

pisan sources the main and local config files. Local config files overwrite main config

It then reads in arguments from src/general_args.sh and functions from src/basic_functions.sh
