COMMANDS
+ Align:
-------- 
	star = STAR basic alignment of RNA-seq data

+ Conversions:
-------------- 
	++ bam/cram/sam
		bammerge = merges multiple bam files -> sorts -> indexes
		bam2bw = bam to bigWig
		bam2fq = bam/cram to fastq	
	++ bed/bedGraphs/wigs/bigWigs
		bedGraphToBigWig = bg -> bw


+ irods: 
-------- 
	irodsDownload = main program to download data from iRODS
	irodsSampleInfo = program to get sample information from sample ids
	createProject = Converts the master csv file to tsv file. Useful for extracting cols from csv.
	irodsMergeCramsToBam = After irodsDownload, run this to merge crams to a single bam file.
	
+ rna-seq: 
----------

	countTableSTAR = generate counttable from STAR gene counts
	deseq = run deseq2 
	countTableToTPM = converts counttable to TPM using deseq2 for normalisation
	salmon = salmon quantification
	
+ fusion: 
---------
	ericscript = Uses EricScript for identifying fusion transcripts

+ chip-seq: 
-----------
	macs2 = peak calling and track generation using MACS2
	homerCreateTagDir = creates tag directory using HOMER. Useful if using HOMER functions.
	
+ crispr:
---------
	++ mageck:
		mageckCount = sgRNA count table.
		mageckCompare = mageck pairwise comparisons from count table.
		mageckXYsgRNA = generates a R markdown file with sgRNA summary plotted.

+ Set operations
-----------------
	++ genes:
		gsea = gene set enrichment analysis using BI GSEA.jar
	++ tables:
		filterCols = given a tsv or csv file, it filters required cols

+ tracks: 
----------
	ucscCreateHub = creates ucsc track hub in web-bfint

+ system:
--------  
	farmsub = main script to submit to farm
	farmhist = history of farm submission in that directory.
	hist = history of pisan commands
